Admins may invalidate or kick troll-posters at their discretion. \n\nArtistic nudity is allowed, but kindly avoid pornographic nudity (as well as any obscenity) as this event is not age-gated. *If in doubt, submit your post as a spoiler. *\nYou will be instantly removed and permanently blacklisted if you post sexualized minors or any such offensive material. \n\nâ–ªâ–ªâ–ª â–ªâ–ªâ–ª â–ªâ–ªâ–ª\n\n__Community Rules:__\n\n**Do not behave in such a way that degrades others' enjoyment of this event. Do not knowingly cause distress.**\nYou may be kicked without warning. *\n\nâ–ªâ–ªâ–ª â–ªâ–ªâ–ª â–ªâ–ªâ–ª\n\n __Sharing Ref__\n\n When posting to /shareref, as with daily posts, artistic nudity is allowed. Avoid pornographic nudity and obscenity. \nSamples are okay to post, but avoid fully posting the contents of paid packs. \nCredit the creator directly: do not use repost links such as from pinterest.
